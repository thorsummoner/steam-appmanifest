Steam AppManifest generator
===========================

This is a short python script that tricks Steam for Linux into downloading non-Linux apps.

Note: Steam will not run apps that don't have Linux support, but it will still download the data.

## How it works

When you tell Steam to download an app, it first checks whether a Linux version exists. If it doesn't exist, it tells you so ("[App] is not available on your current platform.") and doesn't do anything. If it exists, it creates an `appmanifest` file (which contains game meta-data: name, size on hard-disk, time of last update, etc), and then proceeds to download it.

I found that if the `appmanifest` file is created manually, Steam will still download the app regardless of platform. There are a minimum of three variables that have to be set in order for this to work. The first is the `AppID` -- the ID of the app you're trying to download. The second is the `Universe`. [Refer to the Valve Developer Wiki for more info.](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamID#Universes_Available_for_Steam_Accounts) The last and the most magical one is the `StateFlags`. Setting this to `1026` tells Steam that an update is required and that the update has been started previously. More info on `StateFlags` can be found [here](https://github.com/lutris/lutris/blob/master/docs/steam.rst). (Thanks to strycore for pointing this out.)


## Installation Prerequisites

You need Python 2 or 3 and GObject Bindings for the script to run.

* Debian and Ubuntu (and derivatives) don't have these installed by default. The packages are `python3` and `python3-gi`.
* ArchLinux and derivatives can install `python` and `python-gobject`.
* Fedora should have everything installed by default.
* Mac OS requires python3 bindings for GTK3, which can be installed with `brew install pygobject3 --with-python3`.

## Installation

Install via pip, `--user` can be added to install the script under `~/.local/bin` instead of a system install. Be sure to add <kbd>~/.local/bin</kbd> to your PATH!.
```
    pip3 install git+https://github.com/dotfloat/steam-appmanifest.git
    pip install git+https://github.com/dotfloat/steam-appmanifest.git
```

Alternatively, [download `steam-appmanifest.py` directly,](https://raw.github.com/dotfloat/steam-appmanifest/master/steam-appmanifest.py) Make the file executable (`$ chmod +x steam-appmanifest.py`) and run it `./steam-appmanifest.py`.

## Usage

Run the script

 - `steam-appmanifest.py` (System Install),
 - `./steam-appmanifest.py` (Direct Download) or
 - `~/.local/bin/steam-appmanifest.py` (From Pip or add to your PATH).


A dialog should appear. Type in your Steam Community ID in the top textbox and hit `Refresh`. Make sure your profile is publicly viewable. A list of titles should appear. Install the apps that you want by clicking the checkbox to the left of the Title (and AppID). After you finish, restart Steam.

## Manual

I created the python script for ease of use. However, it is also possible to create the `appmanifest` files manually, without the script.

1. Find the `AppID` of the app you're trying to download. This can be easily done by going on [SteamDB](http://steamdb.info) and searching for it.
2. Go to `~/.steam/steam/SteamApps` or wherever your main SteamApps folder is.
3. Create and open a new file called "`appmanifest_APPID.acf`", replace `APPID` with the actual AppID you found in Step 1.
4. Copy and paste the following and replace `APPID` (the all-caps one) with the one you found in Step 1 and `APPNAME` with the folder name to download to:

```
    "AppState"
    {
      "AppID"  "APPID"
      "Universe" "1"
      "installdir" "APPNAME"
      "StateFlags" "1026"
    }
```

Save and restart Steam.

## Disclaimer

This method isn't guaranteed to work. I've tested it on several games and they all seemed to download fine except for Civilization V, which just made an empty directory.

Steam won't download apps you don't own.
